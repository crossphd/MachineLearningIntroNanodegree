    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decision Trees\n",
    "- Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied. \n",
    "\n",
    "One example real-world application for decision trees is for a bank choosing whether or not to offer a loan to a customer. The features would include things like credit score, account balances, other loans, number that have defaulted, etc. The outcome variable would be whether the customer defaulted on the loan (yes or no). \n",
    "\n",
    "- What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?\n",
    "\n",
    "A major strength of decision trees is that they handle both categorical and numeric features. They also handle outliers fairly well and exclude unimportant features. They can scale well to large datasets with a significant number of features. They are also very useful when the rules used need to be clear.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision trees alone (not ensembled) are not the strongest learners, and thus although simple and quick to run, they often won't perform as well as ensembled models. They are also more prone to overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "- What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n",
    "\n",
    "With the loan example above, banks are often required by law to provide a justification for denials. Decision trees allow visibility into the features that are used to make such decisions. Thus if a decision tree model had high predictive validity, it would be an ideal candidate for use by a bank for loan decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)\n",
    "- Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied. \n",
    "\n",
    "Naive Bayes models are most famous for spam classification, and other types of document classification. The gaussian naive bayes version assumes numeric features have a normal distribution. Another example (that isn't spam classification) would be an HR department classifying potential candidates. Potential features would include current employment status, whether they have a degree, years experience, identified strengths, number of references, etc. The training data would be employees already hired with the outcome class being something like successful or unsuccessful employee. \n",
    "\n",
    "- What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?\n",
    "\n",
    "Naive bayes models often don't need as much data to perform well, so if the dataset is relatively small, naive bayes may be a good choice. They also run relatively quickly. Additionally, since independence between classes is assummed, they tend not to suffer from the curse of dimensionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "- What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering they assume independence amoung the features, which in practice often works quite well, it can lead to problems when there are actually strong dependencies between the features. \n",
    "\n",
    "- What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n",
    "\n",
    "For one, there may not be thousands upon thousands of employees to use in your training dataset. Since naive bayes works well with smaller datasets, it would likely be a good candidate for this example if the number of employees used to train the model is small. \n",
    "\n",
    "### AdaBoost\n",
    "- Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied. \n",
    "\n",
    "Adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) can be applied to other models (e.g., decision trees) to improve performance. The decision tree example above, for a bank choosing whether or not to offer a loan to a customer, would also be a good example for adaboost. \n",
    "\n",
    "- What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?\n",
    "\n",
    "The same benefits for decision trees would apply to adaptive boosted trees. The added bonus is that it combines multiple weaker learners into a single stronger learner. That is the idea of boosting. AdaBoost is a further improvement that works in rounds, where each round it adds classifiers and increases the weighting for instances misclassified by previous rounds.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to above, the weaknesses of the model type(s) being boosted carry over. Additionally, adaboost adds complexity which can lead to difficulty interpreting the model. For example, when trees grow large, and there are a large number of them on top of it all, they can offer up more confusing rules that may seem counterintuitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "- What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n",
    "\n",
    "Since adaboost tends to improve over the base model, if the base model alone (e.g., decision trees) was successfull, adaboost will likely improve the performance by ensembling it and adapting the weights so each iteration improves on the cases where the previous iterations struggled. In a sense, it is a smarter ensembler, and thus would likely provide improved results for the bank when making loan decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: I answered these questions off the top of my head. I've taken graduate level machine learning courses. Thus I did not include any references. I am only taking this intro to machine learning Udacity course because it seems to be a requirement for the Pytorch course I registered for. "

    "Based on the comparison of these 3 models on time, accuracy, and F-score, the winner is AdaBoost. With the exception of time, the AdaBoost model bested the other 2 models. If this dataset were exceptionally large, there may be an argument for using the decision tree model instead, since it was fairly close to adaboost in accuracy and f-score, but ran in a quarter of the time. That being said, this dataset isn't large enough to even consider that, and the time it took adaboost was to train was still quick enough. The naive bayes model didn't win any category and thus needn't be considered further. Considering all the times were within an acceptable range, accuracy and f-score determine our winner. Since adaboost outperformed on both of those metrics when using the full (100%) training dataset, adaboost takes the crown this time."

    "AdaBoost is an ensemble model, meaning it combines simpler models. That is the basic idea behind boosting, to take multiple weak learners and combine them into a stronger learner. AdaBoost stands for adaptive boosting, which takes this one step further. It builds upon the weaknesses of past models with each successive model iteration. In other words, it runs a model and evaluates its performance. In the next iteration, it weights the instances where the previous model performed poorly more heavily meaning it tries harder to get those previous errors correct. Thus, as it builds with each successive iteration, it is tuning the model to address the past weaknesses. With each cumulative iteration, it improves its predictive ability. It then combines these models, each with their own unique strengths (and weaknesses), into a single, stronger model. "
